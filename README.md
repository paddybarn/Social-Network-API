## Description

This project is a social network api run using Mongo-DB.  Strictly focused on back-end operation.  A user can create posts/thoughts that other users can be able to interact with and comment on.  All data is stored and routed using Mongo-DB functions and syntax.

## Installation

## Usage

Open the project and start the server using the npm start command.  Since this is strictly a back-end project, the user will have to use insomnia to test the routes that provide the functionality for creating, reading, updating and deleting posts by a user.
